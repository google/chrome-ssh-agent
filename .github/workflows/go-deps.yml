# File an issue when updates to Go dependencies are available. We can't use the
# standard 'go mod' support in Dependabot or Renovate since we also need to run
# gazelle to update Bazel's dependencies. See the following feature requests:
#   Renovate: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/3347 (Gazelle)
#   Dependabot: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2196 (Bazel only)

  schedule:
    # Run once per-week (Fridays). This creates an issue for a human to address,
    # so don't file new issues too much.
