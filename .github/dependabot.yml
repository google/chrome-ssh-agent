  # Updating go modules also requires running Gazelle to update Bazel
  # repositories, but Dependabot doesn't yet support that. Therefore, we add
  # 'gomod' here to allow Dependabot to track the dependencies but do not allow
  # it to update anything.  We have a separate workflow for updating Go
  # dependencies.
